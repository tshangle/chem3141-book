The QED-HF reference involves the product of an electronic Slater determinant with the photon vacuum state |\\Phi_o\\rangle |0\\rangle, so single excitations can occur as electronic excitations from an occupied orbital \\phi_i to a virtual orbital \\phi_a, the raising of the photon number state from |0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1\\rangle, or both.
