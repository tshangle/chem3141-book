    "# Multiple Stern-Gerlach Apparatus Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stern-Gerlach experiment is a canonical experiment in the intellectual history of quantum mechanics that encapsulates the majority of these concepts and topics (1–8). In many presentations within the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, the Stern-Gerlach experiment is presented in the context of the intrinsic quantized spin of the electron. A reenactment of the original experiment with fun and insightful discussion of the role of sulfur-rich cheap cigars favored by Stern has been provided by Friedrich and Herschbach and is worth mentioning to liven the discussion of the 1922 result (7).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the discovery of the quantization of spin is certainly a significant outcome of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the experiment also provides a beautiful illustration of quantum measurement that can be generalized to any quantum mechanical observable. Sometimes, this experiment is introduced in a style inspired by David Albert's **\"Quantum Mechanics and Experience\"** (5) where the components of spin are given the nicknames of **\"color\"** and **\"hardness\"** – this helps to prevent students from making assumptions about the properties based on their knowledge of spin from general chemistry, etc.  Here, we will make explicit reference to spin, and will subsequently introduce the formalism of spin 1/2 as our first model quantum system.  \n",

    "## The Multiple Apparatus Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of the experiment, we consider the measurement of different components of electron spin using multiple Stern-Gerlach apparatus arranged in sequence. A large number of electrons are prepared in identical quantum states and sent through apparatus that measure either the **z-component of spin** (Sz) or the **x-component of spin** (Sx).\n",

    "A series of experiments are described where 1000 identically prepared electrons are sent through the z-component apparatus, with half emerging through the ↑z port and half through the ↓z port. Similarly, when 1000 electrons are sent through the x-component apparatus, half emerge through the ↑x port and half through the ↓x port.\n",

Of these 500 electrons, **all 500 emerge from the ↑z port** of the second apparatus. Based on this first elaboration, the z-component of spin seems to be a persistent property once measured.\n",

    "1000 electrons are sent through the z-component apparatus with the ↓z port blocked and the ↑z port aligned such that the 500 spin-up-z electrons enter an **x-component apparatus**. Of these 500 electrons, **250 emerge from the ↑x port and 250 emerge from the ↓x port**. Based on this second elaboration, the z- and x-components of spin do not seem to be correlated – knowing the z-component tells us nothing about the x-component.\n",

    "#### Experiment 3: The quantum measurement puzzle\n",

    "# The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of quantum mechanical systems is governed by a set of fundamental postulates that provide the mathematical framework for understanding and predicting quantum phenomena. Here we present these postulates in the context of spin 1/2 systems, using the electron spin as our primary example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postulate 1: The Quantum State\n",
    "\n",
    "**The state of a quantum mechanical system is completely described by a wavefunction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For spin 1/2 systems, any wavefunction can be represented as a vector with 2 complex numbers, corresponding to the amplitudes for the two possible spin states along a chosen axis (typically the z-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spin-up along z-axis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\uparrow_z\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spin-down along z-axis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\downarrow_z\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

    "**General spin 1/2 state:**\n",

    "$$|\\psi\\rangle = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + b \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers called probability amplitudes, and the normalization condition requires $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on some common conventions:** Chemists will often refer to electrons with spin-up along z as $\\alpha$ electrons, and electrons with spin-down along z as $\\beta$ electrons.  In that case, we might refer to the quantum states as\n",

    "Near the end of the term, we will hopefully discuss quantum information science and the concepts of [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit), for which the formalism of spin 1/2 plays an important role.  In that context, the state with spin-up along z is typically denoted $|0\\rangle$ and the state with spin-down along z is typically denoted $|1\\rangle$.  So, let's keep in mind that we might see the following labels used interchangeably in our careers!\n",

While we will try to use consistent notation, it is also important to understand the abstraction inherent in how we talk about quantum mechanics and express problems and situations in mathematical language.  What we can reliably do when talking about some quantum system is describe its properties and different rules that it obeys, and if you as a student can think clearly about these properties and rules, differences in notation will be much less troubling.  \n",

    "**Every observable quantity has a corresponding Hermitian operator.**\n",

    "\n",
    "The Reduced Planck Constant ($\\hbar$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $\\hbar$ (pronounced \"h-bar\") is fundamental to quantum mechanics and appears throughout these postulates. It is defined as:\n",
    "$\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} = 1.055 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J⋅s}$\n",
    "where $h$ is Planck's constant.\n",

    "Energy × Time: [J⋅s]\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: [J⋅s] (the classical physics quantity \"action\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Angular momentum: [kg⋅m²⋅s⁻¹]\n",
    "\n",
    "All three representations are dimensionally equivalent and highlight different physical contexts where $\\hbar$ appears. In spin systems, we often think of $\\hbar$ in terms of angular momentum, since spin is intrinsic angular momentum. The tiny magnitude of $\\hbar$ explains why quantum effects are typically only observable at atomic and subatomic scales.\n",

    "**The only possible results of measuring an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.**\n",

    "Spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of microscopic particles, like their mass and charge. The concept of spin emerges in Dirac's relativistic extension of the Schrödinger equation. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, spin is incorporated into a wave function because we know, from experiment, that quantum particles possess this property. Fundamental particles can be chategorized in one of two ways, based on their spin. **Fermions** have half-integer spin; for example, electrons are fermions with a spin quantum number, $s = \\frac{1}{2}.$ **Bosons** have integer spin; for example, photons are bosons with $s = 1.$\n",

The terms \"up\" and \"down\" refer to the $z$ projection of the spin angular momentum, $m_s \\hbar$, as we just saw in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. From the analysis in the previous section, we know $m_s$ for an electron can take on two values. $\\alpha$ spin electrons have $m_s = + \\frac{1}{2},$ while $\\beta$ spin electrons have $m_s = - \\frac{1}{2}.$\n",
