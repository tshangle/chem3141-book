States of different total symmetry can then be constructed where the overall symmetry is defined by the products of the symmetries of the underlying spin-orbitals. Consider a water molecule, which belongs to the C$_{2v}$ point group, which itself has four irreducible representations ($A_1,$ $A_2,$ $B_1,$ and $B_2$). As such, the Hatree-Fock approach could be used to find wave functions and energies approximating those for the four lowest-energy states with each of these overall symmetries. \n",
